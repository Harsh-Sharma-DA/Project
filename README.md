# 👋 Hi there, I'm Harsh Sharma!

Thanks for dropping by!  
This repository is where I’ve been keeping track of some small but meaningful things I’ve built while learning Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, and a bit of data analysis.

I'm currently a student, just trying to make sense of the tech world — one project at a time.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### 📊 Netflix Data Analysis  
*Location:* Data_Analytics/Netflix_Data_Analytics/  
I used Python (mostly Pandas and Matplotlib) to explore and analyze a Netflix dataset.  
It's simple, but it really helped me understand how data tells a story — things like what kind of content Netflix puts out the most, trends by year, and more.

### 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website  
*Location:* My Portfolio/  
This is a basic portfolio website I made using just HTML and CSS.  
It’s my first attempt at building something to represent myself online, and I plan to keep improving it as I go.

## 🎯 Why I Made This

I created this repo to:
- Practice and apply what I’ve been learning from YouTube crash courses and tutorials.
- Push past the fear of not being “good enough” to share my work.
- Slowly build up confidence and showcase my progress in public.

I'm not an expert (yet), but I'm trying — and that’s something I’m proud of.

## 🔧 Tech I Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (basic queries)
- HTML & CSS
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

## 📌 A Note to Anyone Reading

This repo isn’t perfect — and it’s not supposed to be.  
I’m still learning, still figuring things out. But everything here is real and mine.

If you're just starting out like me, I hope this gives you a little encouragement.  
And if you’ve got tips or feedback, I’m all ears :)

Thanks again for stopping by!

— Harsh 🙌
